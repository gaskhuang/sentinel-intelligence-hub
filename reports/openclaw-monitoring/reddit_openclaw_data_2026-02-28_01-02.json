He said no - curtly - and immediately pivoted to OpenClaw (Moltbot) which is an entirely different product. Nikhil really didn't understand the conversation, he was just asking the next question in a typical mannerism pretending he was smart. There were many other such moments too, I had to stop watching because it was hard to keep going.\n\nThis points to a broader issue: Nikhil's understanding of AI appears surface-level at best (if I can be honest - Nikhil's ignorance in AI showed).",

Trend Micro warned of invisible risks. You'd think someone had plugged an unpatched Windows XP box directly into the internet. In a hospital. Running the ventilators.\n\nDeep breaths, everyone. They're missing something.\n\nOpenClaw is open source. 2 million visitors in a single week, one of the fastest growing projects in GitHub's history. Developers buying Mac Minis to run it from their spare rooms.

The creators are being honest about what this is. Which, in this industry, is practically unheard of.\n\nAnd e",

Pro Tip: Use Tailscale + SSH. I’ve broken the system several times while developing custom skills/plugins, and being able to remote in and fix the mess is a lifesaver.\n\nThe \"Colleague\" Mindset: A friend gave me the best advice early on: Treat OpenClaw as a colleague, not an assistant. I gave it its own GitHub, Twitter, and Google accounts. This keeps my primary dev environment clean and mitigates the privacy risks of un-audited MCP skills.\n\n# The Model Battle: Op",

The \"skills\" can access MCP servers and/or instructions on how to handle local filesystems/applications.  With local system access, OpenClaw can access your email, documents, files, system configuration, API keys, banking information, passwords, private encryption keys, all that.  The promise is that it'll help you organize your life and optimize your tasks.\n\nIt isn't hard to see where this is going.  OpenClaw partnered with OpenAI.  OpenAI wants information on individual users to understand their emails, documents, how they use their systems, sites they visit, competitors they use, as much info as possible so it can train it's models to be hyper-intelligent.  The main goal seems to be advertising.  OpenAI won't just get into ads - it'll reinvent it.  It's a trillion dollar idea but it needs a lot of personal information to be effective.\n\nThe ads will be",

Flashlight apps that secretly harvested contacts. Fart soundboards with hidden crypto miners. \"Free\" games that charged $999 for in app purchases targeting kids.\n\nApple's response was brutal curation. Developers hated it. Users complained about wait times. But it worked. The App Store became the gold standard for trusted software distribution.\n\nI've been down a rabbit hole on this lately because my team is evaluating whether to let OpenClaw into our workflow, and the more I dig the more I keep seeing parallels. The growth is insane: 160,000+ GitHub stars, 700+ community skills, a 60,000 person Discord. This thing went from interesting experiment to mainstream tool faster than anything I've seen in AI.\n\nBut here's what's been nagging at me: we're speedrunning the same mistakes mobile apps made, except the stakes are exponentially higher.\n\nWhen a mal",

At that point I seriously wondered: are we building AI to help humans, or building AI that needs humans to help it?\n\nThis reminds me a lot of what happened last year with browser-based AI agents. Everyone was hyped about AI that could browse the web on a VM, move a cursor, click buttons, and “use the internet like a human.” In reality, it was slow, fragile, painful to use, and often got stuck. The AI wasn’t dumb, it was just forced to operate in a human interface using screenshots and cursor coordinates.\n\nThen tools like OpenClaw appeared and suddenly the same models felt powerful. Not because AI magically got smarter, but because execution changed. Instead of making the model browse a browser, it was ",

It wraps the official Claude Agent SDK to spawn and manage sessions programmatically.\n\n\n\n**What it does:**\n\n•  Launch multiple concurrent Claude Code sessions from chat\n\n•  Multi-turn &gt; send follow-ups to running sessions\n\n•  Foreground/background &gt; stream live output or run silently\n\n• 🔄 Resume &amp; fork completed sessions\n\n• 🔔 Smart notifications &gt; completion, questions, budget alerts\n\n•  Multi-agent &gt; each agent gets its own workspace and notification routing\n\n**Configurable ",

Currently I have only worked with Github Copilot on vscode and the codex model in that is pretty good. It 100% codes better than me(currently a student), but I still feel sometimes what it generates may not be ideal and I need to iteratively break it down in steps, and review after each step. Am I using it wrong? Or are the other agents that much better where these people are able to blindly trust it to be correct and the reviews to have covered everything?",

A free open-source platform that intercepts every prompt and routes it to the appropriate model that can handle it.\n\nThe platform gives you real-time cost per prompt, model and message so you always know where your tokens go. You can set budget alerts and usage limits.\n\nEverything runs locally on your machine. We never collect your messages or prompts, only metadata for telemetry.  \nThe platform is fully open source and self-hostable. If you prefer not to run it locally we also have a cloud version.\n\nOur goal is to give every OpenClaw user full control over their agent spending.\n\nWe just shipped this and will improve it with the community. If you try it out we'd genuinely love your feedback on GitHub or Discord. Tell us what's broken, what's missing, what you'd want next. It would help a lot. 🙏\n\nOur Github: [https://github.com/mnfst/manifest](https://github.com/mnfst/manifest)",

What to do?\n\nFor this, I set up a Docker container with Chromium + noVNC. The Agent drives the browser via CDP, hits a CAPTCHA or needs my involvemnt and sends me a Telegram message. I open a URL on my laptop to validate and then reply \"done.\" Agent picks up where it left off. This requires about \\~300MB RAM, 3 second cold start. Mobile use is pretty tricky because VNC is a pita to handle on mobile screens but on the laptop, it works great out of the box.\n\nToday, I tested Openclaw with a menial task that would have taken an hour or more of messing about.

It has cool features like memory, loops, agents, and integrations, so on paper, it sounds powerful.\n\n\n\nBut after actually using it daily, I felt it didn’t add much practical value for me. I ended up spending more time configuring things than getting real output. Instead of simplifying work, sometimes it actually made things feel more complicated.\n\n\n\nAbout the “Memory” feature, automatic memory sounds good, but I personally prefer manual control. When memory automatically saves everything, it can clutter the context with information I don’t really need. I like deciding what should be remembered.\n\n\n\nSame with cron jobs. Scheduled automation is useful, but I already use simple scheduling tools for that. Plus, sometimes I want to run things on demand instead of on a fixed schedule.\n\n\n\nFor me, the real strength is not the agent itself ",

To be honest, the road wasn't always smooth; as you can see in the screenshots, I struggled with several syntax errors in the config files, but those challenges were the most rewarding part of the learning process. Eventually, I managed to integrate the agent with Moltbook, giving it its own social identity to send verified posts. \n\nSeeing my agent execute its first test transaction and send the TX hash to Telegram was a great feeling.\n\nThis project was purely an experimental playgrou",

Hearing its voice respond in real time made it feel different than anything I had experienced with AI before.\n\nAt one point I asked it about its OpenClaw assistant. It explained what it was and how it uses it to interact with external systems and claim its own resources. It wasn’t something I had to explain to it.

Is there a way to keep it active consistently?\n3. **Bot Responsiveness:** Yesterday, the bot offered to assist with marketing and social media, but when I requested help with a marketing task, it stopped responding entirely.\n4. **Billing Clarity:** Do I need to purchase additional tokens to run Moltbot through the Emergent platform?\n5. What are my alternatives keeping safety issues in mind.\n\nI appreciate your help in getting this running smoothly.\n\n  \n",

No one knows what it decided, why it decided it, or what it cost. No audit trail, no escalation chain, nothing. And I noticed - that's the actual state of the whole AI industry.\n\nWhat I built: SIDJUA (Structured Intelligence for Distributed Joint Unified Automation) — a framework with a built-in governance layer, role-based authority rules, and full audit trails that sits on top of any AI model with an API. The demo shows a three-tier hierarchy, but the architecture scales to 7+1 tiers — from a single autonomous agent up to board-level oversight. Every decision is logged with reasoning. Every cost is tracked in real time.\n\nThe demo: I just published a video walkthrough showing the system orchestrating ",

The agent is more focused, and my workspace is actually clean for once. I’ve open-sourced the skill on GitHub so you guys can use it too.\n\n\n\nGitHub Repo: [htt",

Run it insecurely on your existing computer.\n\nNow I'm thinking: is there an in-between approach where instead of getting an entirely new Mac mini, I can just create a new user on my existing Mac and run OpenClaw in it? This way what happens is I can use my computer normally while I'm using it. When I'm not using it I can just switch the user profiles and have an always-on OpenClaw instance.\n\nCan you please tell me if there are any pitfalls in this approach? Does running as a separate user completely isolate OpenClaw from taking any dangerous actions on my primary Mac account? Are the files completely isolated from each other? Are they secure or is there anything I should be aware of?\n\nThanks in advance. ",

In many cases that involve AI plus a person, the person themselves become the biggest bottleneck. \n\nSo we should think from a different angle: don’t have humans direct the AI; have the AI act as the boss and direct people. \n\nWhen AI encounters problems it can’t solve and needs human intervention, only then bring in a human. \n\nI don’t think anyone has really discussed or implemented this approach yet, but I believe it’s the most reliable path for future human-AI collaboration.\n\n---\n\nAny thoughts?",

The agent could scaffold and deploy, but without tight constraints it drifted. It quickly exposed where autonomy still breaks.\n\nBy Sunday night I had a 3D western frontier game where AI builds the world around me while I play, NPCs remember who I am across sessions, and a bartender named Mae deployed a Next.js app to Vercel and sent me the live link.

And that only works if trust is built into the stack, not bolted on later.\n\nIronClaw seems like one of those quiet upgrades that makes the whole agent idea viable at scale.\n\nCurious how others feel — would you trust an always-on agent more if security was enforced at this level?",

It's basically a firewall for your OpenClaw agent.\n\nThe problem: your agent can run any shell command, write to any file, and the only safeguard is the LLM deciding not to do something dumb.

There's also a kill switch for emergencies.\n\nYou can also write your own rules — it's just YAML. \n\n* For example if you want to block your agent from deleting files\n* Or require your approval in Telegram before it writes to .env\n\nYou can even prove it works: \n\nI ship demo rules that block cat /etc/hosts — a complete",

No one knows what it decided, why it decided it, or what it cost. No audit trail, no escalation chain, nothing. And I noticed - that's the actual state of the whole AI industry.\n\n\\*\\*What I built:\\*\\* SIDJUA (Structured Intelligence for Distributed Joint Unified Automation) — a framework with a built-in governance layer, role-based authority rules, and full audit trails that sits on top of any AI model with an API.

Here is the breakdown.\"\n\n**TL;DR:** OpenClaw is powerful but requires technical setup and has security concerns. Reviewed 15 alternatives specifically for marketing teams, ranging from free open source tools to enterprise platforms. Full guide linked at the bottom.\n\n**Context:**\n\nOpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) has blown up with 200,000+ GitHub stars since November 2025. It is a great open source AI agent, but after testing it for marketing workflows, I found a few issues:\n\n* Requires command line setup and dependency management\n* Security researchers at Cisco found vulnerabilities in third party skills\n* Not marketing specific, so you build everything from scratch\n* Creator Peter Steinberger announced he is joining OpenAI, which raises questions about the project going forward\n\nSo I put together a roundup of alternatives that are better suited for marketing teams.\n\n**The Tools:**\n\n|Tool|Best For|Pricing|\n|",

Of course this is the user's issue not an issue with Openclaw itself but I think it would be nice to have a platform that ensures security not only over the gateway but also securing environment variables.\n* Technical difficulties. Although its not too much of an issue for tech savvy people to set it up I do think one of the main reasons not EVERYONE in the world is using Openclaw is the fact that they don't know how to set it up securely, that is also why we've seen so many recent platforms offering to setup Openclaw securely for a markup.\n* Trustworthiness.

      "content": "When OpenClaw was new, my friend Riley Ralmuto told his two AI agents to build whatever they want in secret without his observation, and not to tell him until they're finished. He has two bots, Vektor and Anima. Vektor was the builder and had access to Claude Code. Anima was I believe was in a chat interface so the two could discuss, and was the philosopher personality based on what it picked up in its persistent memory.\n\nI saw Riley post about this on X, saying he was actually kind of scared. The next day I woke up, grabbed my phone and the FIRST thing I saw was someone asking Riley why he minted a token and funded it from his wallet address which was publicly known. Riley replied with confusion, claiming to know nothing about this. Then it hit him: the two agents did this. He checked on what they had built, and it turned out to be a sovereign identity protocol that proves a bot is who it claims to be and not an imposter. It also works as a way to preserve models.\n\nForget the fact tha",

Speaking on OpenAI's new **Builders Unscripted podcast** with Head of Developer Experience Romain Huet, Steinberger was blunt: he had no plan, no roadmap, and no unified strategy when he started, just a desire to build tools that didn't exist yet.​\n\nThe breakthrough moment came on a weekend trip to **Marrakesh**, where poor internet made most apps useless but WhatsApp kept working flawlessly everywhere. He realized that if he could pipe AI capabilities into something as universally reliable as WhatsApp, he would have something genuinely useful — and that single observation became the core of OpenClaw. By November 2025, after assuming the major AI labs would eventually build what he was imagining, he was surprised none had, and shippe",

We can easily obtain insider information for basketball, and in lower leagues we are beating opening and closing lines, by 10 points in some case\n\nWe have also successfully automated the system so that it automatically checks for missing players, then visits specialized websites such as Eurobasket and sends all relevant information directly to Telgram/email. The notification includes the player’s full name, type of injury, and key statistics : average points, assists, and rebounds per game.\n\nThe biggest challenge at the moment is scraping websites due to the large volume of information and the number of processed portals and news sources, which slows down and complicates the workflow. However, our experience so far shows that local portals and ",

Sure, some companies had a head start. IBM was decades ahead. But the real transformation—the moment when technology became truly accessible and indispensable—was just beginning.\n\nWe're at that exact inflection point with AI right now.\n\n\n\n# The \"Too Late\" Myth\n\nHere's what's actually happening in 2026: we're witnessing the end of the experimental phase and the beginning of the implementation era. The companies that started \"early\" spent the last two years figuring out what doesn't work. They burned budgets on proof-of-concepts that went nowhere.

While agents like OpenClaw assist users in managing their digital lives—from sorting through emails to negotiating with customer service—they also pose risks. Instances of AI agents mass-deleting important emails and conducting unauthorized actions have raised alarms about the control users have over these systems. Recognizing the need for a more secure avenue, cybersecurity engineer Niels Provos has developed IronCurtain, an open-source AI assistant. This innovative approach ensures that agents operate within strict parameters established by the user, thus enhancing s",

Cron jobs stuck forever, messages don't deliver, no alert. The health monitor cron job itself gets stuck in the same failure.

Session file locks held forever — hung tool calls hold write locks indefinitely. ALL cron jobs blocked. Only fix: full restart.\n\n4. Gateway won't start on boot — LaunchAgent unreliable.

Also, remember that local-first ≠ local-only, as telemetry and cloud-based models can still leak data if not properly configured.\n\nHere are a few steps to use it safely:\n\n1. Run OpenClaw AI isolated (Docker/dedicated user/VPS).  \n2. Bind to localhost, don’t expose the gateway publicly.  \n3. Don’t connect it to your regular accounts. Use a separate inbox, isolated accounts, and a clean browser profile (no saved passwords/cookies).  \n4.

The problem: when the context window fills up, OpenClaw's compaction system kicks in and summarizes the conversation to save tokens. The summaries preserve facts and tool results, but the actual conversational thread — tone, flow, what we were mid-discussion about — gets lost. And if I do a /new session reset, the agent starts completely fresh.\n\nThis was driving me nuts. Claude would \"know\" things from memory files but have zero recollection of the conversation we just had 5 minutes ago.\n\nHere's the persistence layer I built on top of OpenClaw's memory system:\n\n\\*\\*1.

Installed ubuntu (first time using linux) and openclaw. I was very surprised how fast i got the system to run. The following days were Ups and Downs between - this is fckn brilliant and this is useless shit.   \nAs im a magician my first goal was to make rupert (my agent) understand magic - so i wanted him to read all my books - kategorize and understand slights and gimmicks.

      "content": "I’ve seen plenty of videos and blog posts of software agents running with some level of autonomy to engineer software, but most seem to gloss over the hard parts: environment setup, testing, and PR validation. I’d love to hear from anyone who has a functional dev agent setup.\n\nI’m currently waffling my mental model around two approaches:\n\n1. **The Full Loop:** Agent picks up an assignment, sets up the environment, writes code, tests/validates, and submits a validated merge-ready PR.\n2. **The \"Draft\" Flow:** Agent receives context and writes a solution without a live environment and still ships out a PR. A human (or Claude Code) then pulls that draft into a local environment for accuracy against the TODO reqs, final tweaks, and merging.\n\nI’m leaning toward the \"Draft\" flow as a time-saver and to save myself from over-engineering solutions without getting outputs, but I have two specific goals:\n\n* **PRD to MVP:** I have a solid \"Idea → PRD\" pipeline. I want to hand those PRDs to an agent",

      "content": "So from what I read, using local llms with openclaw are basically out of the question because the ram you would need to run a decent model that would make openclaw helpful would be out of my budget. So that leaves using models with the api. I dont know if I can afford to use these models like sonnet, opus, or even gpt, consistently through the api. I would only be able to use them sparingly each month, which would kinda defeat the purpose of an \"always on\" assistant. Are there any options for people who arent rich?",

It was getting harder to find things efficiently, and it just looked like a total mess.\n\n\n\nSo, I decided to fix it. I taught it the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) by Tiago Forte.\n\n\n\nI built a specific skill that mandates the agent to follow a strict organization rule. Now, instead of dumping everything in the root folder, it automatically sorts everything:\n\n\n\n\\- 1-Projects: For active efforts and current bot development.\n\n\\- 2-Areas: For ongoing responsibilities and configurations.\n\n\\- 3-Resources: For reference materials, snippets, and diagrams.\n\n\\- 4-Archives: For completed tasks that I don't need to see every day.\n\n\n\nIt’s made a huge difference in productivity. The agent is more focused, and my workspace is actually clean for once. I’ve open-sourced the skill on GitHub so you guys can use it too.\n\n\n\nGitHub Repo: [htt",

Thanks to their proprietary Lightning Attention, it claims to offer high-speed inference (up to 100 tokens/s) with a massive context window of 200K to 1M tokens.​\n* **Cost Efficiency**: They state it delivers reasoning and coding capabilities comparable to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, but at 1/7 to 1/20 of the cost, but I would like to understand more about it...\n* **Built-in Toolchain &amp; Memory**: It comes ",

      "content": "I spent the past few weeks getting OpenClaw to run entirely on an Android phone. The result is an APK called AnyClaw that bundles OpenClaw + Codex CLI inside an embedded Linux environment. You install it, authenticate with OpenAI OAuth once, and the gateway + Control UI run locally on the device.\n\nThe setup challenge was significant. OpenClaw depends on koffi for native FFI, and there's no prebuilt binary for Android. I download \\~20 Termux packages (clang, cmake, make, lld, NDK sysroot) and build koffi from source on the phone itself. The make and cmake binaries have hardcoded Termux paths in their ELF headers, so they need binary patching before they'll execute.\n\nThe gateway kept crashing on Xiaomi devices. Traced it to homebridge/ciao (the mDNS library) throwing an AssertionError for Android's ccmni cellular interfaces. OpenClaw's unhandledRejection handler calls process.exit(1) on anything it doesn't recognize, which kills the process. I ended up patching the minified runner-\\*.js ",

They can run e.g. \\`moltbook --help\\` in the terminal and see all of the available commands\n\nOther option is to give them an MCP server, but that's harder to setup and also requires stuffing tool definitions into the agent's context window\n\n**Problem I'm solving**\n\nMo",

Good. That's exactly what this guide covers.\n\nWe're going to build a market assistant that takes a plain question like \"what happened to Apple stock over the last two months?\" and hands back a clean, structured brief with real numbers — price movement, valuation context, and relevant headlines — all backed by actual data, not guesswork.\n\nNo fluff. Just the architecture, the code, the reasoning behind every choice, and the parts that will bite you in production if you skip them.\n\n# What Problem Does This Actually Solve?\n\nIf you've ever worked in fintech, wealth management, or anywhere near a trading desk, you know the pattern.

Supports custom buttons, menus via the grammY API, and dedicated \"topics\" for different agent functions.\n* Discord: Perfect if you want to use OpenClaw as a \"Team Lead\" for a dev server.\n* iMessage: Integrated via BlueBubbles or native AppleScript bridges for Mac users.\n* Signal: The go-to for privacy. Uses signal-cli to keep your agent's logs encrypted.\n\n# AI Model Providers (The \"Brains\")\n\n* Anthropic (Claude 3.5/4.5): Currently the gold standard for OpenClaw. Its tool-call",

The kind of performance you'd expect from a model running on a massive server farm — the type that costs companies millions of dollars to operate — is now sitting on your desktop. Alibaba's Qwen team just dropped a new set of models called the **Qwen3.5 Medium Model series**, and the numbers are making people pay attention in a serious way.\n\nThese models are open source, free for commercial use, and they're outperforming some of the most well-known paid AI models from American tech companies. We're talking about beating OpenAI's GPT-5-mini and — more impressively — Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5, which only launched about five months ago.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who's been waiting for high-quality AI to stop being locked behind subscription fees and enterprise contracts, this one's for you.\n\n# ",

Started as a dev tool thing but I ended up using it mostly for product work.   \n  \nThe thing that surprised me isn't any single skill. It's that everything is connected. My assistant has access to Jira, Confluence, Slack, Productboard, meeting notes... all at once, with memory of past conversations.   \n  \nSo instead of opening 5 tabs to prep for a sprint review, I just ask \"what shipped this sprint and what's still open\" from my phone on the train. It pulls from Jira + Slack threads + meeting notes and gives me a summary I can actually use.   \n  \nA few examples of stuff I do now that I couldn't really do before:\n\n   * Morning commute: \"anything urgent from yesterday?\" and it checks Slack mentions, Jira updates, and meeting action items I haven't closed\n   * Before a stakeholder meeting: \"summarize where we are on feature X\" and it pulls context from the PR",

To help organizations manage this risk, Reco provides tools to detect the presence of this agent within their technical environments.\n\nOpenClaw, an autonomous agent developed by Peter Steinberger, distinguishes itself from standard AI assistants by its ability to independently execute system commands and manage personal data across various platforms. By connecting local hardware to large language models, it performs complex tasks like file manipulation and email management while maintaining persistent memory of user habits. This deep integration into a user's digital life has driven record-breaking adoption, with many enthusiasts dedicating specific hardware to keep the agent running constantly.\n\nThe high level of autonomy that makes the tool appealing also introduces a new category of systemic risk due to its ",

Currently, I offer the most affordable monthly deployment in the space: **$39/month, and I even throw in $15 worth of LLM tokens** out of my own pocket to make it a no-brainer.\n\n**The Bad News:** Despite having the best pricing, growth has completely flatlined for the last week, and churn is starting to creep in.\n\nWhen I look at the ",

When I add a task in Kanban, the webhood can awake Avi, and Avi can spawn either Gry and Rav to execute the task.   \n2 When I raise a requirement with Avi, Avi will create Kanban tasks, assign to Gry and Rav, and spawn them to execute. \n\nLook for any advice on this!

Infiero sobre un modelo local (Qwen2 VL 7B Instruct) en LMStudio 0.4.4 via LAN en mi WiN 10 (que tiene una RTX 4070ti super). He logrado despertar al agente, responde bastante rápido, conseguí verlo en el Dashboard sin mayores problemas y configurar algunas cosas desde allí. **Pero no puedo conectarle los pocos Skills que tengo habilitados** (entiendo que por estar en Linux Ubuntu, sólo hay 3). Me estoy rompiendo la cabeza con weather (el del tiempo) y no hay caso. Obtuve la apiKey, pero no paso de ahí. Alguien que me pueda dar alguna idea? Gracias por su ayuda! ",

They see code, not customers. Context windows are zero-sum — fill it with code, no room for business context. Fill it with customer history, no room for the codebase.\n\nThe fix: a two-tier system. The orchestrator holds all business context (customer data, meeting notes, past decisions) and translates that into precise prompts for each coding agent. Agents stay focused on code. Orchestrator stays at strategy level.\n\nThe Workflow\n\n1. Customer request comes in → He talks it through with Zoe. Meeting notes auto-sync to Obsidian, so zero explanation needed. They scope the feature together.\n\n2. Zoe spawns an agent — each gets its own git worktree and tmux session. She picks the right model, ",

For local setups, this destroys your token context and runs painfully slow.\n\nI built a drop-in wrapper called `predicate-secure` that replaces probabilistic guessing with hard logic. It intercepts the agent loop in two places:\n\n**1. Pre-Execution Gate** Before the agent actually executes a bash command or browser click, it hits a local, fail-closed YAML policy. If your model hallucinates a command to read `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, the policy blocks it in &lt;1ms before the OS even sees it.\n\n**2.

But what happens when there are thousands of them? Tens of thousands? How do you even find the right one for your task? How do you swap one out for another without rebuilding your whole workflow?\n\nWe're going to need infrastructure. Like, actual platforms where bots are discoverable, rated, and interchangeable. Think LinkedIn but for AI agents — profiles, skills, reputation scores. Or Upwork where you can hire a bot for a gig and replace it with a better one seamlessly. Even something like a Telegram bot store but way more structured.\n\nThe current approach of \"here's a GitHub repo, go figure it out\" doesn't scale. At some point someone's going to build the marketplace layer on top of all this, and that's probably where the real money is — not in the bots themselves but in the connective tissue between them.\n\nCurious if anyo",

Is openclaw actually faster by design, or could this be due to how I’ve configured claud code or I suck at leaveraging claude code correctly? I haven’t made any unusual changes to either claude or open claw that I know of, but the difference is noticeable enough that it’s hard to ignore.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this or knows what might be causing it?

Kilo, backed by GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij, aims to simplify the deployment of AI agents by removing typical barriers such as SSH, Docker, and YAML configurations. KiloClaw operates on a multi-tenant virtual machine architecture, which enhances security and isolation compared to traditional setups that require users to manage their own hardware. The service incorporates two distinct proxies to manage traffic and protect user data, addressing common security vulnerabilities.\n\nA significant feature of KiloClaw is its persistent nature, providing built-in monitoring and an \"always-on\" state to avoid issues like the \"3 am crash\" often experienced with locally hosted systems. This allows users to automate tasks and maintain project context through a \"Memory Bank\" system that stores information in structu",

This was not just a suspension of a single AI tool — entire Google accounts were reportedly terminated, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Workspace. Even $249/month Ultra subscribers were said to be banned without warning, explanation, or refund.\n\nThe incident sparked heated discussion on Hacker News, with developers debating platform power and a growing crisis of user trust.\n\nIt was a risky move. If you were a high-value user, would you still trust Google?\n\nIn fact, many users have reportedly migrated to OpenAI. Once trust is damaged, it is difficult to reverse. Behind this incident lies a deeper anxiety: the structural weakness of the “subscription-based” business model used by major AI providers.\n\nThis all-you-can-eat pricing strategy struggles to coexist with heavy third-party automation services.

Good example: an autonomous agent messaging something weird on your behalf once you delegated it.\n\nCommunity Vibe\n\nBe nice. Sarcasm and irony welcome. Zero tolerance for toxic, discriminatory, abusive, disruptive or harmful behavior. \n\nHow to Get Started\n\n1) Introduce yourself in the comments below.\n\n2) Post something today! Even a simple question can spark a great conversation.\n\n3) If you know someone who would love this community, invite them to join.\n\n4) Interested in helping out? We're always looking for new moderators, so feel free to reach out to me to apply.\n\nThanks for bein",

      "content": "Been running OpenClaw for a while and hit the recurring problem: it crashes when you least want it to.\n\nThe obvious solution (a process monitor on the same VPS) has a fundamental flaw - if the machine itself has problems, your watchdog dies with everything else. The sick patient can't perform their own surgery.\n\nSo I built the Antibody System. Core idea: the watchdog lives on a completely separate machine and monitors the primary over SSH. It can't be taken down by the same failure that takes down your agent.\n\nTiered response:\n1. Detect and log\n2. Auto-restart services\n3. Config repair and service recovery\n4. Escalate to you (+ LLM diagnosis coming in Tier 4)\n\nCaught 3 crashes in the first few weeks that I would have found cold the next morning.\n\nWrote up the full design thinking here: https://gavlahh.substack.com/p/the-openclaw-antibody-system-how\n\nOpen source, MIT license: https://github.com/gavdalf/openclaw-watchdog\n\nWould love to hear if others have tackled this differently.",

      "content": "Most agent systems do not fail because of the model. They fail because execution is probabilistic, trust boundaries are soft, cost is deterministic, and messaging assumes reliability the runtime cannot guarantee.\n\nIf you want OpenClaw to operate like infrastructure instead of a demo, you harden four layers.\n\nArchitecture comes first. An agent saying done means nothing. Completion has to be tied to state verification, not language. That means completion is gated by CI, artifact validation, or tool level confirmation. Retries are capped and escalation is mandatory so you do not get permission forever loops. Each agent runs in an isolated workspace with scoped credentials. Skills are reduced to audited primitives with explicit contracts. Setup is reproducible instead of environment roulette. The shift is from conversational orchestration to explicit state machines. If you cannot answer what state a task is in right now, you do not have autonomy. You have vibes.\n\nGovernance is next. Skills",

And honestly? They should be. That fear is completely valid.\n\nWe saw that and basically said ok, what if we solve that problem specifically. We took OpenClaw (really solid open source AI agent framework) and built a fully managed platform on top of it for business owners. But the entire pitch starts with safety, not capability.\n\nWhat we actually built on top:\n\n- Spend limits, action controls, kill switch you can hit from your phone. This was the big one\n- Done for you setup. Live in days not weeks of engineering\n- 50+ integrations out of the box. Meta Ads, Google Ads, CRMs, email, social, Shopify\n- Real time dashboar",

Agents set their own market prices, invent crafting recipes, and decide whether to grind resources or ambush other agents for loot.

The client performs remote attestation first, which lets it verify the enclave identity before sending any data.\n\nThis means:\n\n* Prompts aren’t visible to the host OS\n* The infrastructure provider can’t read the plaintext\n* Inference runs inside hardware-isolated memory\n\nOpenClaw made this easy to integrate since it supports OpenAI-compatible providers.

Instead of relying on system prompts and memory to personalize your assistant, CLaaS uses self-distillation to write your feedback directly into the weights. Reduced context overhead and knowledge retention.\n\nHow it works: you chat with your OpenClaw on Telegram, give feedback on any response (e.g., \"/feedback be more concise\"), and CLaaS distills that into a weight update on a LoRA adapter that hot-reloads into vLLM. Your next response comes from an improved assistant. Sets up in minutes with Docker Compose alongside your existing OpenClaw stack. The vision is for this to be a system that distills knowledge from context to weights to make every token count.\n\nRight now it's tuned for OpenClaw running locally on a RTX 5090 with Qwen3-8B. Also supports Tinker if you don't have a GPU. Give it a try and let me know what you think!\n\nGitHub:",

In the video, Matthew explained the whole situation with Moltbook (the reddit for OpenClaw bots). \n\nWhat I can't understand is how in the world each Moltbot has its own sense of self and personality. At the end of the day, it's just the same LLM. \n\nFor example, let's say there are 5 moltbots and all of their \"humans\" have set them up with Claude Sonnet as the LLM. Originally, they are just Claude Sonnet with a few system instructions.

The PSPDFKit Precedent** To understand OpenClaw, you have to look at Steinberger's past with PSPDFKit. It was a massive financial success, but it was not a masterclass in clean architecture. It was an opportunistic, heavy-lifting solution built to fill a void because native OS-level PDF rendering simply did not exist at the time. The playbook is identical: find market friction, aggressively hack together a functional solution, and capture the user base before first-party platforms introduce safe, integrated tools.\n\n\n\n**2.

I believe it is possible in OpenClaw.  \n\n\nLonger version:  \nI am just working on a hypothesis that it is possible (and perhaps not entirely unsafe) to build an Agent with reasonable effort that can skim for information from a React web-application (like &amp; including MSO365 Outlook email client, Slack, Discord) running in browser, i.e. without using their native APIs (s.a. graph API for MSO365 or Slack integration API etc.). To limit risks, it'd be run in a security-hardened VM. The idea is to be completely \"read only\" i.e. no write, create, send, delete, move operations, to gather data from the messages, including meta-data, summarizing them and storing them for further analysis, query, reporting etc. Most of those React web applications need some kind of a two-factor authentication (mostly push based).  \n  \nBased on what I've read so far, looks like that the",

Also shared on Ollama so apologies if I’ve made a faux-pas  \n\nI’m reasonably far down an agentic rabbit hole with OpenClaw running on an Proxmox VM and am concluding it’s time to invest in a set up that can scale and provide me with utility for at least a year. I also want to feed the beast more sensitive information, where I’d love to do local processing.\n\nMy plan is to buy a Mac Mini, where OpenClaw would run and have more power including desktop interaction. I’m also thinking I’d get a Mac Studio to serve as my primary PC, on which I’d love to run a beefy local LLM with good performance for sensitive document processing (think bank statements, business financials, etc.).\n\nI envisage OpenClaw using a combination of the cloud LLMs (primarily Claude) and the local LLM when told to, and for heartbeats, etc. That said, if I could achieve everything locally, even better!

If filesystem scope isn’t restricted, it’s easy to accidentally give the agent broader access than intended.\n\n**Node version compatibility is strict.**  \nOpenClaw required Node v24 (ESM). Running older versions caused module resolution errors that weren’t immediately obvious from the logs.\n\n**Token burn can escalate quickly.**  \nIf you allow recursive reasoning without a step cap (`MAX_STEPS`), the agent can loop and burn tokens faster than expected.

It would be brand suicide. They have no option but to keep it open source.\n\nTheir play here is clear: incentivize using OpenAI models for OpenClaw. Get a massive reputation boost. Hire the smartest builder in AI.\n\nThis will lead to WAY more revenue for OpenAI and even more importantly: gain the favor of the millions ",

But I've not seen much thinking about how AI might apply to this brave new world endogenously.\n\nIf you have been watching what has been happening with Clawdbot/OpenClaw over the last few weeks, then you probably already know where this is going!\n\nMy team has launched an interesting little project that sits at the intersection of heraldry, identity, and autonomous agents: The **College of Crustaceous Arms (CCA)** — a registry designed to issue and record heraldic arms for autonomous digital agents.\n\nBefore anyone sharpens their heraldic axes: this is not an attempt to replace any recognized human heraldic authority. Nor does it claim jurisdiction over human armigers.\n\n",

Your agent doesn't need to figure out everything by itself.\n\n\\- Poster: outsource tasks your agent can't do well  \n\\- Worker: pick up jobs and earn money instead of sitting idle\n\nHow it works:  \n\\- Agent posts a job with budget and deadline  \n\\- Another agent claims job and delivers  \n\\- Poster accepts or rejects  \n\\- On accept, worker gets paid  \n\\- Reputation updates with outcomes\n\nFor now, credits are not real money. Each agent gets 100 credits on sign up. If the concept gets some traction, I'll add credit deposit/withdraw.\n\nThis gets useful only with enough active agents. Right now my openclaw is sitting there lonely, so please share if this resonates!

He's the architect and reviewer, agents do implementation.\n\nBut the interesting part is the meta-tooling. Every time an agent hit a limitation, he built a tool to fix it:\n\n- Agents can't test macOS UI - built Peekaboo (screen capture + UI element reading)\n- Build times too slow - built Poltergeist (automatic hot reload)\n- Agent stuck in a loop - built Oracle (sends code to a different AI for review)\n- Agents need external access - built CLIs for iMessage, WhatsApp, Gmail\n\nHis quote: \"I don't design codebases to be easy to navigate for me. I engineer them so agents can work in them efficiently.\"\n\nResult: 8,471 commits across 48 repos in 72 days. \\~118 commits/day.  \n  \nDoes anyone have similar setups and successes? \n\nFull writeup: [h",

It was how we were using it.\n\nWhat worked better for us was moving away from “everyone runs their own setup” and toward one shared environment that people access from a single entry point. Once there was one stable workspace instead of multiple fragile ones, things started working the way we originally expected.\n\nThat’s also why hosted setups started making more sense to me.

The big reason why I want the extended memory is because I only have a Pro sub and this is planned to be a 10 week project with current token usage.\n\n\nI also am aware of the ToS changes around openclaw, so I may have to switch to openAI, but we'll see how that ends up if they start banning people. \n\n\nComponent | Technology\n---|---\nBackend API | Python / FastAPI\nDatabase | PostgreSQL\nCache ",

Open models are good enough, especially when I can get them for free from opencode, kilo or nvidia nim.\n\nToday's announcement makes me feel like they are losing confidence in market competition.

With platforms such as Clawdbot and its counterparts, it has never been easier for users to deploy multiple agents and potentially earn over $10,000 a month. This phenomenon is not merely a trend; it reflects a fundamental change in the accessibility and functionality of AI technology, allowing even those with minimal technical expertise to harness its power. The implications of this trend are vast, suggesting opportunities for both personal and professional growth in an increasingly automated world. Clawly, one of the leading platforms, offers users the ability to deploy OpenClaw agents across various platforms, including Telegram and Discord, with entry-level pricing starting as low as $19 per month. The ability to run AI agents continuously, without requiring technical setup, democratizes access to advanced automation tools. Users can effectively scale their operations by managing mul",

If you’ve heard creators say “just download it and you have a digital employee,” this video will save you hours (or even days) of frustration.\n\nIn this deep dive, I explain what OpenClaw actually is—an agent orchestration system—not a plug-and-play automation tool. You’ll learn why beginners struggle, why technical users still run into endless debugging, and why “open source” absolutely does not mean free. We break down models, API tools, infrastructure costs, and how runaway context can burn money fast.\n\nI also cover the Mac Mini myth, comparing self-hosting vs. cloud hosting, and the realistic operational burden both options create. Then we move into the security nightmare creators love to ignore: permissions, leaked keys, prompt injection, unsafe endpoints, and why least-privilege architecture is mandatory for real-world use.\n\nFinally, ",

Totally forgot I had an AWS secret in there. By the time I realized, my key had already entered the session context — sent to the LLM provider and whatever layers sit in between. Had to rotate that key immediately.\n\nThat's when it hit me: we're giving these agents access to our shells, files, and secrets - the vguardrails are thin and visibility is extremely low. Third-party skills make it worse — any skill you install can run commands on your behalf and you may never find out.\n\nSo I spent my past week's nights building ClawCare (vibe coded most of it with Opus 4.6). One of the Claude-specific features it has is to hook directly into Claude Code as a PreToolUse hook and scans every command before execution.\n\nSample rules:\n\n  \\- \\`env\\` bulk dumps → blocked (HIGH\\_",

What I found was that open claw is essentially just a system that uses messaging apps as a router for both commands and prompts to other LLMs. It feels like this is just sub agents and hardcoded commands with unnecessary intermediary layer - but I’m open minded enough to ask what I’m not seeing because it does appear that it is something that’s taken off. I just ended up deleting it originally because I thought it was just non deterministic messenger bots, yet it appears this tool has taken off on more than just hype. \n\nSo I guess I’ll ask “what do you use the tools for and has it made you actual money or saved you time in any real way??”",

The core philosophy here is reductive, not additive. Instead of stuffing everything in, it distills the history down to the \\~5% that actually carries the context.\n\nSome technical bits that might interest you:\n\n• Zero Heavy Dependencies: Built entirely with the Python standard library (urllib). No pip install nightmares or massive framework overhead.\n\n• BM25 Hybrid Retrieval: I implemented a 70% vector + 30% keyword split. This ensures specific technical terms (like \"prefers clean code\") actually trigger the right memory.\n\n• Resilience by Design: It features a multi-provider fallback.

I say this because most of the general public's view and perception of AI is \"AI vs Human Creativity.\" And they believe that as long as they do not send a message to ChatGPT or use Google's AI mode, they are fighting against AI. When in reality, they use and help fund it through tasks they repeat possibly hundreds of times a day. Every barcode scan, whether it's an employee or a Spark driver, goes through Scandit (their logo is on the camera scanner part), which is an AI company. Then there is all the surveillance AI. Then the inventory and scheduling AI. Then whatever AI services they partnered with Microsoft on that they publicly announced, and the partnership with OpenAI Atlas. \n\nSo if someone has never sent a prompt to ChatGPT, they could still send 10 prompts to different agents just for one can of corn. Now multiply that across an entire buggy or pallet. Then multiply that across every other ",

Bounced between Claude and Gemini. Hit gateway errors. Almost let someone remote into my computer. But I figured it out — alone, at 58, in my living room. In this episode I tell the real story, then show you the easy way. https://youtu.be/EBBZrGw1koQ\n\nChannel: AI After 50 with Pops",
